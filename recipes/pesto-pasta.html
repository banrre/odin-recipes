        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You can make pesto pasta with any pasta your heart desires. And even in today's recipe video, I say to use your favourite pasta.</p>
        <p>But I do have my preferences. <strong>My favourite is penne or ziti</strong> (which is just penne with a smooth surface). I find it's the easiest to toss for even distribution and you get the “juiciest” pesto pasta.</p>
        <p><strong>Spaghetti</strong> and other thin(-ish) long strand pastas are <strong>my next favourite</strong>. I find that it's not quite as easy to toss the pesto through and the more you work the pasta, the less saucy it becomes (though you just keep adding pasta cooking water, but there's only so much you can add).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 quantity homemade pesto</li>
                <li>300 - 350 g / 10 - 12 oz pasta of choice</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup pasta cooking water</li>
                <li>Parmesan, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the salt.</li>
            <li>Add pasta and cook for the length of time per the packet.</li>
            <li>Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot).</li>
            <li>Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky.</li>
            <li>Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
